## Graphic Design Theory

### The Anatomy of Typography

- **Kerning**: Spacing b/w characters
- **Leading**: Spacing b/w sentences/phrases
- CUSTOM SPACING --> design with different FONT TYPES --> pay attention to spacing and white space that can be utilized between fonts ![Anatomy of Typography](assets/TheAnatomyofTypography-Poster.jpg)

### Different Type Styles

- SERIF --> tails at end that help accentuate the letter or character
  - helpful when there's a large amount of text, little accents help the reader distinguish the letters much easier
- SANS-SERIF --> Lack Accents
  - make pretty solid and clean headlines
- SCRIPT --> have own special use in design, add more natural look, can easily overwhelm design piece
- FONT PAIRING --> Serif and Sans-serif go well together, rarely two different of the same style look good together
- FONT WEIGHT --> Light -- Bold, some have all in between
- Two different weights in same family pair well together
- SPACING
  - lowercase not good spaced out
  - scripts meant to be at default
  - Kerning (Manual), Tracking(Computer), Spacing(General Term)

### History of Serif Fonts

- OldStyle
  - Used when Publishing was first getting started, Italian printers were interested in creating a type that was easy to read for book printing
  - not a large difference in contrast, the thickness of the lines or strokes
  - Garamond, Berkley, Minion, Palatino
- Transitional
  - Established in the mid 18th century (between old and modern)
  - contrast between thickness of lines adn the characters are more dramatic
  - Instead of harsh endings, fonts tend to end with ball terminals (rounded ends of type stems)
  - Times New Romans
- Didone/Modern
  - Characterized by more dramatic contrasts between the thickness and thinness of the lines and the typeface
  - Didone, Didot, Bodoni (commonly found in design programs as a default option (canva))
  - highly stylized --> commonly found in high end fashion brands
- Slab Serif
  - originally designed to demand one's attention on poster designs
  - have very thick, bold lines with almost zero contrast
  - chunky, thick and bold (wanted posters in old west)
  - political statements
  - Rockwell (IBM logo used custom font very close to it), Archer, and Archer Pro

### Sans-Serif Fonts

- _Sans_ = "WITHOUT" in French --> lack tails or accents on the characters
- Serif fonts in the past 20 years have taken a backseat to sans serif fonts
  - have more modern, clean, and sleek appearance
  - sometimes lack the subtle elegance or charm needed in a particular situation --> modernism and minimalism
- USE OF digital and computer screens required a more clean and simple font back when computers had a low resolution display and the small details fo serif fonts were lost
- Poster Design - BIG BOLD HEADLINES
- In small body copy that comes in large blocks of text it can sometimes get lost (great for websites and digitacl mediums) but in print projects --> serif font works a little better
- Helvetica --> works well with tight spacing especially when lowercase
- Futura --> Mathematically precise

### Using Typography in Design

- Texts and Photos do not have to fight each other but can begin to become on unified layout and design
- white space is necessary

### Font Pairing

- Serif and Sans-Serif tend to work well as a pairing
- 2-3 fonts per design
